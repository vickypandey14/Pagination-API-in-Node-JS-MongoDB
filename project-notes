Work Progress Update on 17-04-2024:

- Installed Extension: Rest Client
- Created a new file: requests.Rest

- Expanded the Node.js application to include pagination functionality for both users and posts APIs.

- Created separate routes for users and posts endpoints, each serving paginated data.

- Utilized a reusable middleware function `paginatedResults` to handle pagination logic for different data models.

- Implemented asynchronous data fetching for both users and posts data from the JSONPlaceholder API.

- Integrated pagination metadata (next and previous links) into the API responses for enhanced navigation.
